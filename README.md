## Game of 3
Given any number, repeatedly divide the number by 3 till you reach 1. 
Add or subtract 1 whenever division by 3 is not possible. 
At each stage output the number.
e.g. if you start with 100, itâ€™s not divisible by 3, so subtract 1.
100, 99
Then keep dividing by 3
100, 99, 33, 11
11 is not divisible by 3, so add 1.
100, 99, 33, 11, 12
Keep going till you get to 1.
100, 99, 33, 11, 12, 4, 3, 1
