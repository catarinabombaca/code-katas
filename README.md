## Game of 3
Given any number, repeatedly divide the number by 3 till you reach 1.   
Add or subtract 1 whenever division by 3 is not possible.  
At each stage output the number.  
e.g. if you start with 100, it’s not divisible by 3, so subtract 1.  
100, 99  
Then keep dividing by 3  
100, 99, 33, 11  
11 is not divisible by 3, so add 1.  
100, 99, 33, 11, 12  
Keep going till you get to 1.  
100, 99, 33, 11, 12, 4, 3, 1  

## Rotate
Write a function that rotates a slice by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by 2 becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2].  
Bonus: Try solving this without creating a copy of the slice.  

## Square or square root
Write a method, that will get an integer array as parameter and will process every number from this array.
Return a new array with processing every number of the input-array like this:  
If the number has an integer square root, take this, otherwise square the number.  

### Example

`[4,3,9,7,2,1] -> [2,9,3,49,4,1]`

### Notes

The input array will always contain only positive numbers, and will never be empty or null.
